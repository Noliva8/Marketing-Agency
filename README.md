# ðŸ“– codebase that follows accessibility standards


To achieve this we make sure:

the webpage meets accessibility standards
HTML elements are semantic 
 Review the structure of the HTML elements
 find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
view the icon and image elements
 find accessible alt attributes
 view the heading attributes
they fall in sequential order
 view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
